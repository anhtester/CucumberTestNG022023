Feature: Login to CRM
   As a user, I want to be able to log into the CRM system
   So that I can manage customer information

   Example: Successful login
      Given I am on the login page
      When I enter my username and password
      And I click the Login button
      Then I should be taken to the Dashboard page
      And I should see the "Customers" menu

   Scenario Outline: eating
      Given there are "<start>" cucumbers
      When I eat "<eat>" cucumbers
      Then I should have "<left>" cucumbers
      Examples:
         | start | eat | left |
         | 12    | 5   | 7    |
         | 20    | 5   | 15   |
